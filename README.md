# NLP
## Vietnamese news topic classifier
The goal of this project is to predict which topic an article belongs to. Training and testing data is scrapped from a Vietnamese news website. Data is transformed to consumable format, and used to train various machine learning models. Each model will be evaluated to measure their performance.
We scrape articles from vnexpress.net, the most well-known digital news site in Vietnam. 

Source of news articles used: [vnexpress.net](https://vnexpress.net/)
